multipipe\n\nA better `Stream#pipe` that creates duplex streams and lets you handle errors in one place.\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/segmentio/multipipe.png)](http://travis-ci.org/segmentio/multipipe)\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar pipe = require('multipipe');\n\n// pipe streams\nvar stream = pipe(streamA, streamB, streamC);\n\n// centralized error handling\nstream.on('error', fn);\n\n// creates a new stream\nsource.pipe(stream).pipe(dest);\n\n// optional callback on finish or error\npipe(streamA, streamB, streamC, function(err){\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Duplex streams\n\n  Write to the pipe and you'll really write to the first stream, read from the pipe and you'll read from the last stream.\n\n```js\nvar stream = pipe(a, b, c);\n\nsource\n  .pipe(stream)\n  .pipe(destination);\n```\n\n  In this example the flow of data is:\n\n  * source ->\n  * a ->\n  * b ->\n  * c ->\n  * destination\n\n## Error handling\n\n  Each `pipe` forwards the errors the streams it wraps emit, so you have one central place to handle errors:\n\n```js\nvar stream = pipe(a, b, c);\n\nstream.on('error', function(err){\n  // called three times\n});\n\na.emit('error', new Error);\nb.emit('error', new Error);\nc.emit('error', new Error);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### pipe(stream, ...)\n\nPass a variable number of streams and each will be piped to the next one.\n\nA stream will be returned that wraps passed in streams in a way that errors will be forwarded and you can write to and/or read from it.\n\nPass a function as last argument to be called on `error` or `finish` of the last stream.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install multipipe\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT
