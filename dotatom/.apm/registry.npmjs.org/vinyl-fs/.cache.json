vinyl-fs [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coveralls Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Dependency Status][depstat-image]][depstat-url]\n## Information\n<table><br><tr><br><td>Package</td><td>vinyl-fs</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Description</td><br><td>Vinyl adapter for the file system</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Node Version</td><br><td>>= 0.10</td><br></tr><br></table>  \n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar map = require('map-stream');\nvar fs = require('vinyl-fs');\n\nvar log = function(file, cb) {\n  console.log(file.path);\n  cb(null, file);\n};\n\nfs.src(['./js/**/*.js', '!./js/vendor/*.js'])\n  .pipe(map(log))\n  .pipe(fs.dest('./output'));\n```\n\n## API\n### src(globs[, opt])\n- Takes a glob string or an array of glob strings as the first argument.\n- Globs are executed in order, so negations should follow positive globs. For example:\n\n```js\nfs.src(['!b*.js', '*.js'])\n```\n\nwould not exclude any files, but this would\n\n```js\nfs.src(['*.js', '!b*.js'])\n```\n\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n  - base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`.\n    - Default is where the glob begins if any.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()` if there is no glob.\n\n  - buffer - `true` or `false` if you want to buffer the file.\n    - Default value is `true`.\n    - `false` will make `file.contents` a paused Stream.\n\n  - read - `true` or `false` if you want the file to be read or not. Useful for stuff like `rm`ing files.\n    - Default value is `true`.\n    - `false` will disable writing the file to disk via `.dest()`.\n\n  - since - `Date` or `number` if you only want files that have been modified since the time specified.\n  - stripBOM - `true` or `false` if you want the BOM to be stripped on UTF-8 encoded files.\n    - Default value is `true`.\n\n  - passthrough - `true` or `false` if you want a duplex stream which passes items through and emits globbed files.\n    - Default is `false`.\n\n  - sourcemaps - `true` or `false` if you want files to have sourcemaps enabled.\n    - Default is `false`.\n    - Will load inline sourcemaps and resolve sourcemap links from files\n    - Uses `gulp-sourcemaps` under the hood\n\n  - followSymlinks - `true` if you want to recursively resolve symlinks to their targets; set to `false` to preserve them as symlinks.\n    - Default is `true`.\n    - `false` will make `file.symlink` equal the original symlink's target path.\n\n  - Any glob-related options are documented in [glob-stream] and [node-glob].\n\n- Returns a Readable stream by default, or a Duplex stream if the `passthrough` option is set to `true`.\n- This stream emits matching [vinyl] File objects.\n\n_Note:_ UTF-8 BOM will be stripped from all UTF-8 files read with `.src`.\n\n### dest(folder[, opt])\n- Takes a folder path as the first argument.\n- First argument can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n  - base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`.\n    - Default is the `cwd` resolves to the folder path.\n    - Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n\n  - mode - Specify the mode the files should be created with.\n    - Default is the mode of the input file (file.stat.mode) if any.\n    - Default is the process mode if the input file has no mode property.\n\n  - dirMode - Specify the mode the directory should be created with.\n    - Default is the process mode.\n\n  - overwrite - Specify if existing files with the same path should be overwritten or not.\n    - Default is `true`, to always overwrite existing files.\n    - Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns `true` or `false`.\n\n  - sourcemaps -\n    - Default is `null` aka do not write sourcemaps.\n    - Uses `gulp-sourcemaps` under the hood\n    - Examples:\n      - Write as inline comments\n      - fs.dest('./', {sourcemaps: true})\n      - Write as files in the same folder\n      - fs.dest('./', {<br>  sourcemaps: {<br>    path: '.'<br>  }<br>})\n      - Any other options are passed through to `gulp-sourcemaps`\n      - fs.dest('./', {<br>  sourcemaps: {<br>    path: '.',<br>    addComment: false,<br>    includeContent: false<br>  }<br>})\n\n- Returns a Readable/Writable stream.\n- On write the stream will save the [vinyl] File to disk at the folder/cwd specified.\n- After writing the file to disk, it will be emitted from the stream so you can keep piping these around.\n- If the file has a `symlink` attribute specifying a target path, then a symlink will be created.\n- The file will be modified after being written to this stream:\n  - `cwd`, `base`, and `path` will be overwritten to match the folder.\n  - `stat.mode` will be overwritten if you used a mode parameter.\n  - `contents` will have it's position reset to the beginning if it is a stream.\n\n### symlink(folder[, opt])\n- Takes a folder path as the first argument.\n- First argument can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n  - base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`.\n    - Default is the `cwd` resolves to the folder path.\n    - Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n\n  - dirMode - Specify the mode the directory should be created with.\n    - Default is the process mode.\n\n- Returns a Readable/Writable stream.\n- On write the stream will create a symbolic link (i.e. symlink) on disk at the folder/cwd specified.\n- After creating the symbolic link, it will be emitted from the stream so you can keep piping these around.\n- The file will be modified after being written to this stream:\n  - `cwd`, `base`, and `path` will be overwritten to match the folder.\n\n[glob-stream]: https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-stream\n[node-glob]: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob\n[gaze]: https://github.com/shama/gaze\n[glob-watcher]: https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-watcher\n[vinyl]: https://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl-fs\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/vinyl-fs.svg\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.svg?branch=master\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/wearefractal/vinyl-fs\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.svg?style=flat\n[depstat-url]: https://david-dm.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs\n[depstat-image]: https://david-dm.org/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.svg\n","maintainers":[{"name":"fractal","email":"contact@wearefractal.com"},{"name":"phated","email":"blaine@iceddev.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-09-28T09:55:31.054Z","created":"2014-01-16T04:35:13.183Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-16T04:35:13.183Z","0.0.2":"2014-01-22T23:32:53.983Z","0.1.0":"2014-03-01T21:54:54.733Z","0.1.1":"2014-03-17T22:22:42.477Z","0.1.2":"2014-03-17T22:34:49.764Z","0.1.3":"2014-04-17T01:35:55.240Z","0.1.4":"2014-04-17T10:26:05.990Z","0.2.0":"2014-06-01T02:29:09.354Z","0.2.1":"2014-06-03T00:34:12.928Z","0.3.0":"2014-06-10T07:45:37.441Z","0.3.1":"2014-06-25T14:27:39.226Z","0.3.2":"2014-06-25T18:34:05.869Z","0.3.3":"2014-06-26T16:34:58.575Z","0.3.4":"2014-06-27T06:06:48.755Z","0.3.5":"2014-07-30T23:03:26.698Z","0.3.6":"2014-08-02T04:55:03.590Z","0.3.7":"2014-08-29T07:08:34.064Z","0.3.8":"2014-09-29T22:16:51.236Z","0.3.9":"2014-10-09T18:35:26.373Z","0.3.10":"2014-10-22T06:49:42.812Z","0.3.11":"2014-11-04T18:58:05.741Z","0.3.12":"2014-11-13T23:01:29.908Z","0.3.13":"2014-11-13T23:18:36.009Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-01T23:10:20.475Z","0.3.14":"2015-09-21T23:58:14.914Z","2.0.0":"2015-09-25T22:43:41.873Z","2.1.0":"2015-09-27T22:01:07.451Z","2.1.1":"2015-09-28T09:55:31.054Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"http://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.git"},"author":{"name":"Fractal","email":"contact@wearefractal.com","url":"http://wearefractal.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs/issues"},"users":{"conradz":true,"tunnckocore":true,"kxbrand":true,"stringparser":true,"carlosmarte":true,"edin-m":true,"drew.brokke":true,"h02e56":true,"simplyianm":true,"9joneg":true,"n370":true,"itonyyo":true,"xieranmaya":true,"evan2x":true,"awen1983":true,"wilson0x4d":true,"fotooo":true},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"ERDO076JTCN7Q98GV8TY7OPBK\""}
