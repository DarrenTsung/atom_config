(You still can if you prefer!!).\n\n# Current known issues\n* Only \"list\" and \"text\" question types are supported.  (More to come!)\n\n# Less task switching...\nNeed to add a model or a controller?  Normally use a generator for that task?   You can run sub generators too...\n\n![In Action](https://github.com/david-driscoll/atom-yeoman/raw/master/atom-yeoman-sub.gif)\n\n# Empowering Packages\natom-yeoman lets package authors bundle one or more generators and execute them programmatically through the atom-yeoman framework.\n\n## `yeoman-environment` service\natom-yeoman exposes the `yeoman-environment` service.  This lets you call `atom-yeoman` as you see fit for your package.\n\n### run(generator: string, cwd?: string)\nRuns the given generator (aspnet:app, aspnet:Class, jquery, etc.)\nYou may optionally give the cwd that you would like the generator to work from.\n\n### start(prefix?: string, cwd?: string)\nRuns atom-yeoman as if you had run the `yo` command.\nOptionally you can give the prefix, so you can have yeoman only show a subset of the available generators.\nYou may optionally give the cwd that you would like the generator to work from.\n\n### Note on setting cwd\nIf you don't set the cwd, then atom-yeoman will try to determine the best location for you.\n\n* If atom has no projects open, a warning notification is thrown.\n* If atom has one project open, that projects path is chosen.\n* If atom has more than one project open, then the user will be prompted to choose the correct path.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/david-driscoll/atom-yeoman/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/david-driscoll/atom-yeoman#readme","_id":"atom-yeoman@0.3.14","_shasum":"a481c849ce926db314ac251c1e5d0cda40f9e826","_resolved":"file:../d-115824-14773-oxd6lp/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115824-14773-oxd6lp/package.tgz"}
