Repository status information get displayed in footer.\n\nThe `git-diff` package has to be enabled to see the repository status marks in gutter and treeview.\n\nThis package uses a __binary svn wrapper__. So you have to put your svn-binary in your os __searchpath__.\n\nThis package plays well with third party plugins(like minimap-git-diff) who consume the `repository-provider` service.\n\n## Installation ##\n### From atom GUI\nGo in Atom's **Settings** page, through **packages** section.
