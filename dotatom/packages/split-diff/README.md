# split-diff package

Diffs text between two split panes. The diff is updated when any changes are made. New panes are created if less than two panes exist upon run of the package.

## Usage

### Commands

| Command | Effect | Default Keymaps |
| ------- | ------ | --------------- |
| `Toggle` | Toggles a diff of the text between two side-by-side panes. Creates panes as needed. | ... |
| `Ignore Whitespace` | Toggles the Ignore Whitespace setting. | ... |
| `Move to Next Diff` | Scrolls to the next chunk of the diff and highlights it. | `ctrl-alt-n` |
| `Move to Previous Diff` | Scrolls to the previous chunk of the diff and highlights it. | `ctrl-alt-p` |

The `Toggle` command is unique; it will create panes as necessary. Here are the situations that could arise:

* If there are **no panes** open, then it will create two *empty* panes to paste your diffs into.
* If there is **one pane** open, then it will diff the pane against a newly created *empty* pane to paste your diff into.
* If there are **two panes** open, then it will diff the two panes.

To stop diffing, simply close one of the panes *or* use the `Toggle` command.

*This package will unfold all folded lines in order to properly align the diff.*
*It will also temporarily turn off soft wrap in the two panes in order to properly align the diff.*

### Settings

* **Ignore Whitespace** - Will not diff whitespace when this box is checked.
* **Diff Line Characters** - Diffs the characters between each line when this box is checked.
* **Left Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the left editor.
* **Right Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the right editor.
